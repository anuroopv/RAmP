The major advantage and use of RAmP is to provide one-stop experience to analyse not only proteomic data but also modified proteomic data such as acetylome, phosphoproteome, possibly lactylome and other similar proteomics data from MaxQuant output flies. You can get multiple analysis by running a single function, adding the parameters and in few minutes, voila! all you files from every analysis are automatically saved to your working directory

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(RAmP)
```
